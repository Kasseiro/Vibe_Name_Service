# Prompt log

Owner: Daniel. Everyone adds entries.

Add an entry for every prompt whose output got committed, and for every prompt
that failed in an interesting way. A two-line entry written now beats a
detailed one written in week two from memory. Mark entries worth using in the
report with ★ so sections 3.2 and 3.3 can be pulled straight from here.

IDs run V-001, V-002, ... Put the ID in
the commit trailer (`Prompt: V-014`).

When a prompt is a retry of an earlier one, link it with `Refines:`. A chain
like V-007 → V-009 → V-012 is a ready-made row for the iteration log table (3.3).
